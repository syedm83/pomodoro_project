<h1>Pomodoro App Overview</h1>

<h3>Problem: Students and professionals working long hours need tools to manage their time effectively, especially with breaks.</h3>
<h3>Solution: Building an advanced Pomodoro timer tailored for professionals, including features like break reminders, task prioritization, and a dashboard to track productivity. Use JavaScript for setting and adjusting timers and tracking work intervals. HTML and CSS will help create a smooth UI </h3>

My application aims to aid students and professionals with time management goals. Users can create their own goals using the "Manage Tasks" button, and can even choose their own study time using the customizable timer.
